# ChainBot
basic fishing bot for doodle world
## Usage
1. download all dependancies (listed in `setup.py`)
2. customize `config.toml` based on your setup
3. add a small screenshot of the doodle you're trying to chain to `/images/target`. make sure the screenshot is taken in the same configuration you'll be running the game, in since the image recognition works through comparing pixels directly
4. setup your .env file with the two fields `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `CHANNEL_ID`
5. run `chainbot.py`
